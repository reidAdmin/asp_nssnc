' Here we have used the 2Checkout.com system as an example of how a common payment
' processor works. You can edit this file to match the details of your particular payment system

' Payment systems will normally pass back 3 different pieces of information. One will be the order
' id that we sent with the transaction. The second will be the authorization code and sometimes a
' variable will be passed back indicating the success of the transaction. You can use these to
' check that the order did indeed come from the payment system you are implementing
